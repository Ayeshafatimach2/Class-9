/*Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each 
person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but 
each message should be personalized with the person’s name.*/

let _name: string[] = ["Ayesha", "Saman", "Fatima"];
for (let index = 0; index < _name.length; index++) {
    console.log("Hello", _name[index] + ", I hope you are doing well");
